## :godmode: **About me**
I'm a junior web developer who did a 10 month formation at [BeCode]('http://Becode.org') where I learn to be a web dev. 
I like to create funny stuff during my free time, like extension firefox. I also play *Versus Fighting Games* who push me to always be better en analyze my skills.
